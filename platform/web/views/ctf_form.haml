      %h1.centered Trial CTF competition

      %h3 Declaration of consent

      %p
        In this trial competition, participants will be asked to solve a number
        of small exercises in computer security (similar in format to computer
        security Capture-The-Flag competitions, such as the
        = succeed ').' do
          %a{ :href => 'https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-ctf.html' }> DefCon |
          CTF |
        These exercises are automatically generated for each participant
        from templates prepared by humans. The competition is hosted to allow me
        (Gábor) to analyse the effect of various techniques present in the
        exercise generator which aim to increase the variability of the
        generated exercises.
      %p
        To facilitate said analysis, the system may record any user
        interaction during the competition. This may include (but is not
        necessarily limited to) timing information, data explicitly submitted
        (such as flags), and communications with the actual exercise. All
        recorded data are stored under a randomly chosen anonymous identifier
        until they are no longer necessary or at the latest until 1st July
        2017, when they will be erased. Aggregate information based on the
        recorded data or small samples of anonymous data may be conserved
        indefinitely for the purpose of inclusion in my (Gábor's)
        dissertation.
      %p
        The competition is fundamentally anonymous. This means that all data
        generated are stored under the aforementioned anonymous identifiers.
        However, an email address is requested below to serve both as a means of
        verifying that participants have given their consent and a way for me
        (Gábor) to contact individual participants, should that be required for
        operational reasons. Therefore, a mapping between anonymous participant
        identifiers and email addresses is also stored. However, no personally
        identifiable information will be published at any point.
      %p
        If a participant desires a higher degree of privacy, they may use a
        freshly registered email address (e.g. from Google) instead of one of
        their well known addresses, but they are requested to check their
        emails regularly until at least 1st July 2017. The system also uses
        technical measures to ensure that only I (Gábor) can access the data
        stored. Specifically, the email addresses are stored in a separate
        database, to which the automated system only has write access.
        However, it should be noted that no system is perfectly secure and
        despite the considerable effort invested into making the competition
        system safe, a data breach cannot be completely outruled.
      %p
        Participants may abort the competition at any point without
        justification. They may also contact me (Gábor) for further
        clarification or information at any point using the email address
        below. Participants may request that all information stored in
        relation to them is deleted. Such requests will be swiftly dealt with,
        but participants should note that if by the time of their request the
        data in question was incorporated in some aggregate, it may no longer
        be possible to completely remove all of it.
      %p
        The infrastructure for the competition is being hosted in Microsoft
        Azure, in the 'West Europe' region, which is physically located in the
        Netherlands according to Microsoft.
      %p
        To show my gratitude to participants, two modest prizes are offered. One
        will be offered to the participant that solves all of the challenges in
        the least amount of time, and one will be offered to a randomly selected
        participant that has solved at least two challenges. If a participant
        has earned one of the prizes, I will determine their email address using
        the mapping mentioned earlier and contact them via that email address.
        If this condition is unacceptable to a potential participant, they are
        kindly requested not to proceed with taking part. The prizes will be of
        30 GBP each, and can be claimed in cash, by bank transfer, or Bitcoins.
        In any case, the transfer will happen before 1st July 2017, granted that
        the participant provided the necessary information to allow transfer of
        the prize. If the prize is claimed in Bitcoins, no guarantee can be made
        about the exchange rate. 30 GBP will be exchanged at some point before
        1st July 2017 and the resulting Bitcoins transferred to the winner.
