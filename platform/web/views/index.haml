    %h1 Hello, and welcome!
    %p
      My name is Gábor Szarka (that's me above!), but I often use my online nick
      name, gsx, hence the domain. Currently I am reading Part II of the
      %a{ :href => 'http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/' } |
        Computer Science Tripos                                          |
      at Cambridge University. As my final year project, I have done some work
      on the automated generation of computer security exercises under the
      guidance of
      = succeed '.' do
        %a{ :href => 'https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/' } Dr Frank Stajano
      To be able to properly evaluate my results, I am gathering feedback from
      security enthusiasts and professionals.
    %p
      I am running two experiments. One involves participants trying to solve
      exercises generated by my system, while the other is a more direct
      (survey-like) form of feedback on some of the techniques my challenge
      generator employs. Both studies have been approved by the Computer
      Laboratory Ethics Committee.
    %p
      If you are interested or would like to help out by participating in one of
      the studies, please contact me on the email address below. Thank you!
