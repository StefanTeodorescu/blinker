The user-facing CTF interface. It is a Sinatra-based web application. The
server-side is fairly simple, and for the most part just mediates between the
client-side code and the database. The client-side markup consists of a few HAML
templates, and some (rather poorly structured) Javascript code based on
knockout.js.
